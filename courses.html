      <h1>WEBINARS</h1>
      <p>What is a webinar and can it be used as a language learning tool?🧐
      The answer is simple: of course, it is possible and even necessary. Our webinars are a budget-friendly and very convenient option for learning Russian language, as we present the material in the form of an online lecture conducted by an instructor, the founder of the online school “Language Purpose”. You can not only watch the lecture where you want and how you want, but also get feedback from the instructor immediately after the lesson. Each visitor of the online lecture receives an answer on each question of interest. Let's get to know this world of Russian language together with comfort, ease and saving money! We are waiting for you 🤗</p>

      <h1>COURSES</h1>
      <p>Our Russian language courses are very dynamic and rewarding as we teach you all the Russian language skills at the same time. This is reading, speaking, writing, understanding Russian speech. When you learn any language, you need to develop the ability to quickly reason and produce speech. We will develop these skills together. We present the grammar and vocabulary of the Russian language as a system of specific rules. No water, only useful and important information! You can study both individually and in a group. Welcome to our course 🤓🤝.</p>

      <h1>SPEAKING CLUB</h1>
      <p>I invite you to my course "I speak Russian". This is an online group where you will speak Russian and learn grammar correctly and easily. We can use Skype, Zoom, Telegram or Viber (vote and choose). No other language! Communication is only in Russian from the beginning to the end of the lesson. Help is available in English.
  I want to hear every student, so we all talk for the same length (no offense). Of course, you are a star ⭐, but in our group every person is a star, so we shine together😁👋. Do you have many good ideas? I'm interested to hear what you think and find out what you like. Why not share it?😉</p>
